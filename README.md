# Molecular dynamics simulations of physical vapor deposition for high entropy alloys
## Introduction
High entropy alloy (HEA) is a new idea for alloy design based on combinations of 5 or more principal elements that has been attracting considerable interest. HEAs exhibit many excellent mechanical properties. However, exploring the composition-structure relationships became one of the biggest challenges in this field because of the enormous number of possible HEA compositions. Traditional bulk HEA metallurgy synthesis methods are not suitable for studying the vast composition space of HEAs. A high-throughput synthesis technique such as physical vapor deposition (PVD) enables a fast screening of HEA compositions.
## Methods
LAMMPS and OVITO
## Goal
Investigate the effect of atomic size difference on the microstructure formation in HEA films.  
## Preliminary results
An increased atomic size difference results in a FCC to amorphous phase transition in HEAs.
